# Whats_app_dataanalysis

# Introduction:
Whatsapp has quickly become the worldâ€™s most popular text and voice messaging application. Specializing in cross-platform messaging with over 1.5 billion monthly active users, this makes it the most popular mobile messenger app worldwide.

I thought of various projects on which I could analyse data like - Air Quality Index or The cliched Covid-19 Data Analysis.

But I thought why not do Data Analysis on a WhatsApp group chat of office member and find out interesting insights about who is most active, who are ghosts (the ones who do not reply), my sleep schedule, the most used emoji, the most actives times of the day, or does the group use phones during college teaching hours?

These would be some interesting insights for sure, more for me than for you, since the people in this chat are people I know personally.
